<!-- IMPORTANT: TEAM COLLABORATION
1. Add comments so that others can read your code more easily

2. Be sure to commit your change every now and then so that others can track changes/debug more easily
    * How to commit your change:

      Step 1. git add . / git add <filename>
      (Use 'git reset' to undo)

      Step 2. commit -m "<YOUR NAME>: <TASK>"
      e.g. Anndo: add css code to style the buttons

3. Make a new branch to work on your task and push it to GitHub once you have it done. The purpose of using branches is to avoid messing up with the master branch.
    * How to use branch to collaborate

      Step 1. create a new branch using: git branch <TASK NAME>
      e.g. git branch homepage-responsiveness

      Step 2. switch to the branch you just created using: git checkout <BRANCH NAME>
      e.g. git checkout homepage-responsiveness

      Step 3. (after you complete the task) switch to your master branch using: git checkout master

      Step 4. push your branch using: git push origin <BRANCH NAME>

      Step 5. go to GitHub and create a pull request
